# bootcamp-module-4-challenge
I spent a lot of time on this challenge to insert functionality that was not necessarily necessary, e.g. randomized questions. Given time constraints, I am not able to work out all the bugs or fulfill every single requirement. I prioritized my feature additions poorly.
Nevertheless, you have a basic game that has 6 questions on JavaScript that must be answered in 10 seconds. If you get a question right, your score increases by one, so a high score is currently 6. However, if you get a question wrong, 5 seconds are deducted from the time left to complete the game. Hence, the "impossible." It's not impossible. Just a bit frustrating given the constraints.
